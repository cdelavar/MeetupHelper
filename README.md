# Meetup Helper

Meetup Helper is a ruby CLI that grabs event history from the meetup.com API.It allows you to see a list of past events that you've attended and download pictures from those events. You can also "delete" events that you've rsvp'd to, but did not actually attend; this does not delete the event history from the website, but you can use this feature to virtually delete the events and find a sum total of events you've actually attended.
